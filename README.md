# ft_containers

C++ project where the goal is to recreate 3 of the <algorithm> library : Stack, Vector and Map. Along with some useful tools such as the pair class, enable_if, and iterators.

It was a difficult project for sure but also a interesting one discovering and making AVL trees.
  
## How to run
Make and execute ./ft_containers

It will show you some tests with time comparison with the original library. It should not (and will not if I did my job correctly) exceed 20 times the duration of the original.
